# Balance System - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes made to the referral/commission system to address critical calculation inconsistencies, withdrawal handling issues, and data integrity problems.

## Key Problems Fixed

### 1. **Calculation Inconsistencies**
- **Before**: Different endpoints calculated balances differently
- **After**: Centralized `BalanceService` ensures consistent calculations across all endpoints

### 2. **Withdrawal Handling**
- **Before**: Withdrawals were subtracted immediately upon request
- **After**: Only approved withdrawals are subtracted from available balance

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- **Before**: No transaction support, race conditions possible
- **After**: Proper database transactions for all critical operations

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- **Before**: No tracking of withdrawal processing
- **After**: Complete audit trail with timestamps and admin notes

## New Architecture

### BalanceService Class

The `BalanceService` is the single source of truth for all balance calculations:

```javascript
// Get user balance
const balance = await BalanceService.calculateUserBalance(userId);

// Process withdrawal request
const result = await BalanceService.processWithdrawalRequest(userId, withdrawalData);

// Update withdrawal status (admin)
const result = await BalanceService.updateWithdrawalStatus(withdrawalId, status, adminNote);
```

### Balance Breakdown

The service returns a comprehensive balance object:

```javascript
{
  commissionSum: 150.00,        // Total commission earned
  appreciationSum: 300.00,      // Total appreciation earned
  grossTotal: 450.00,           // Total earnings before withdrawals
  totalApprovedWithdrawals: 50.00,  // Total approved withdrawals
  totalPendingWithdrawals: 100.00,  // Total pending withdrawals
  availableBalance: 400.00,     // Available for withdrawal
  pendingBalance: 300.00        // Available minus pending
}
```

## API Changes

### Consistent Endpoints

All balance-related endpoints now return consistent data:

- `GET /api/referrals/stats` - Complete user statistics
- `GET /api/referrals/balance` - Balance information only
- `GET /api/withdrawals/balance` - Same as above (alternative endpoint)

### Withdrawal Processing

```javascript
// Request withdrawal
POST /api/withdrawals
{
  "amount": 100,
  "bankName": "Test Bank",
  "accountNumber": "123456789",
  "forfeitPurchaseId": 123 // Optional
}

// Admin process withdrawal
POST /api/withdrawals/admin/process
{
  "withdrawalId": 456,
  "status": "approved", // or "rejected"
  "adminNote": "Processed successfully"
}
```

## Database Changes

### New Withdrawal Fields

```sql
ALTER TABLE Withdrawals ADD COLUMN forfeitPurchaseId INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE Withdrawals ADD COLUMN forfeitedAmount DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Withdrawals ADD COLUMN adminNote TEXT;
ALTER TABLE Withdrawals ADD COLUMN processedAt DATETIME;
```

### Indexes for Performance

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_withdrawals_user_status ON Withdrawals(userId, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_withdrawals_status_created ON Withdrawals(status, createdAt);
```

## Business Logic

### Commission Calculation
- **Rate**: 15% of approved purchases from referred users
- **Trigger**: Only when referred user's purchase is approved
- **Limitation**: No time limit on commission earning

### Appreciation Calculation
- **Rate**: 1% per day on user's own approved, active purchases
- **Duration**: Maximum 60 days per purchase
- **Trigger**: Calculated from purchase creation date

### Withdrawal States
- **Pending**: Request submitted, awaiting admin review
- **Approved**: Admin approved, funds deducted from balance
- **Rejected**: Admin rejected, funds restored (if forfeited)

### Purchase Forfeiture
- User can forfeit 85% of an active purchase to increase withdrawal amount
- Forfeited purchases become inactive immediately
- If withdrawal is rejected, purchase is restored to active state

## Security Improvements

### Input Validation
- All monetary amounts validated as positive numbers
- Bank account information validated for length and format
- Purchase ownership verified before forfeiture

### Transaction Safety
- All balance modifications wrapped in database transactions
- Atomic operations prevent partial updates
- Rollback on any failure

### Authorization
- User can only access their own balance/withdrawals
- Admin endpoints require proper authentication
- Withdrawal processing restricted to admins

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
npm test -- --grep "BalanceService"
```

### Test Coverage
- Balance calculations with various scenarios
- Withdrawal processing edge cases
- Admin operations and error handling
- Concurrent operation handling

## Migration Guide

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### 2. Update Routes
Replace old route files with the new implementations:
- `routes/referrals.js` → Use new referrals route
- `routes/withdrawals.js` → Use new withdrawals route

### 3. Add Service
Place `BalanceService.js` in the `services/` directory.

### 4. Update Models
Update the `Withdrawal` model with new fields and methods.

### 5. Update Frontend
Frontend applications may need updates to handle new response formats:

```javascript
// Old format
const balance = response.balance;

// New format
const balance = response.availableBalance;
const pending = response.pendingBalance;
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Balance calculation consistency across endpoints
- Withdrawal processing times
- Failed transaction attempts
- Fraudulent withdrawal attempts

### Logging
The service includes comprehensive logging:
- All balance calculations
- Withdrawal requests and processing
- Error conditions and recovery

### Database Queries
Monitor query performance on:
- Balance calculations (can be expensive with many referrals)
- Withdrawal lookups
- Admin dashboard queries

## Error Handling

### User-Friendly Messages
- Clear error messages for insufficient balance
- Helpful guidance for invalid requests
- Status updates for withdrawal processing

### Admin Tools
- Detailed error logs for troubleshooting
- Admin dashboard for withdrawal management
- Audit trail for all balance changes

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Caching of complex balance calculations
- Pagination for large result sets

### Scaling Considerations
- Consider read replicas for balance queries
- Implement balance snapshots for high-volume users
- Monitor transaction lock contention

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time balance updates via WebSocket
- Automated withdrawal processing for trusted users
- Advanced fraud detection
- Balance history tracking
- Withdrawal scheduling

### API Versioning
The current implementation maintains backward compatibility, but consider API versioning for future breaking changes.

## Support

### Common Issues
1. **Balance Discrepancies**: Use the centralized service consistently
2. **Withdrawal Delays**: Check admin dashboard for pending requests
3. **Calculation Errors**: Verify purchase and referral data integrity

### Debugging
- Enable detailed logging in development
- Use database transaction logs for audit trails
- Monitor API response times and error rates
